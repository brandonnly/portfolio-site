# Brandon Ly - Personal Site

Hey! If you're reading this you're probably wondering how I made my personal site [brandonly.me](https://brandonly.me).

It's nothing special just plain old HTML and CSS using the [Bulma Dracula](https://github.com/mazipan/bulma-dracula) framework, and deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
